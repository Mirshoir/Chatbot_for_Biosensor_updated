EMG Analysis Results
--------------------
EMG_CH1 - Percentage of time under high muscle activation: 6.63%
EMG_CH2 - Percentage of time under high muscle activation: 5.37%

Explanation of Muscle Activation Levels:

    - The **EMG Envelope** represents the overall muscle activity level by taking the absolute value or using the Hilbert transform of the EMG signal.
    - The **activation threshold** is calculated as the mean plus one standard deviation of the envelope values. This threshold helps identify periods of significant muscle activity.
    - **High Activation** indicates that the muscle is exerting force above the normal resting level, suggesting periods of physical effort or tension.
